# House_prediction_task
This is a task i completed for a deep learning internship role in a company i currently intern at.

I was required to build a predictive model to predict the prices of houses based on different features given in the dataset. I carried out data analysis, visualisations and tried out 2 different ML models in this project which include Linear regression and Lightgbm. I ended up using lightgbm as it performed better
